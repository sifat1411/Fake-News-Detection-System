# Fake News Detection System

## Description

The Fake News Detection System is a machine learning project that uses various classification algorithms to automatically detect and classify fake news articles. The project utilizes the scikit-learn library for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. The implemented classifiers include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare your dataset of labeled news articles and update the file paths in the code accordingly.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes real and fake news articles.
The CSV files Fake.csv and True.csv contain the respective data.
Ensure that the dataset is appropriately structured with relevant columns.
Usage
Open the fake_news_detection.py file in your preferred code editor.
Update the file paths for reading the CSV files (Fake.csv and True.csv).
Run the script to preprocess the data, train the classifiers, and evaluate the models.
You can also use the manual_testing() function to test a news article interactively.
Results
The project evaluates the performance of different classifiers using accuracy and classification metrics.
The classification_report provides detailed information on precision, recall, and F1-score.
